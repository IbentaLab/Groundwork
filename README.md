# GROUNDWORK FRAMEWORK
Thank you for downloading Groundwork.

## About

Groundwork is a robust, powerful yet lightweight Drupal frontend framework that provides a rich set of reusable classes.

Groundwork facilitates the evolution of Drupal core markup and styling by serving as a backwards compatibility layer for its sub-themes, adapting to changes in core markup and CSS.

## Usage

You have the following options to use Groundwork:

1. Find and use existing sub-themes of Groundwork at Drupal.org
2. Create your custom sub-theme using the CustomKit:
- by copying it manually from the Groundwork's directory
- by generating a Groundwork sub-theme using Drush
3. Create your custom sub-theme from scratch and set the *base theme* in your theme's .info.yml file to "groundwork":

`base theme: groundwork`
